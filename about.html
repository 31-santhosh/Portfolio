    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! This is Santhosh, an enthusiastic learner exploring the world of Cloud Computing and Ethical Hacking. I’m currently learning AWS Cloud, focusing on understanding the basics of cloud services, how cloud infrastructures work, and how security plays an important role in protecting them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Alongside AWS, I am developing my knowledge of Linux and computer networking, which helps me understand how systems communicate, how servers operate, and how security issues can arise at different layers. I enjoy applying this foundation while learning ethical hacking concepts, including basic penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and security testing techniques.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I focus on continuous learning through practice, labs, and industry-recognized certifications, aiming to strengthen my understanding step by step and grow into a security-focused cloud professional with strong fundamentals.
